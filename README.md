# Project: BST
A simple project to work with and experiment with different functions and algorithims with a BST.

##
## Learning Objectives
- Installing packages via NPM
- Running test from command line
- Writing Jest tests
- BST algorithms

## Skills used
- Javascript
- Algorithms and data structures

## Current Functions
```
insert(data) inserts data given into the bst, no return
```
```
size() traverses the bst counting all nodes, return number of nodes in bst
```
```
inOrder() preforms an inorder traversal while adding a copy of each node to a list, returns an inorder list
```
